# brainstorm

Brainstorm is an open source project designed to facilitate collaborative brainstorming between groups. We built it using the MERN stack with Redux, Passport, Socket.io, and D3. Our goal was to create a visually interesting brainstorming tool with broad applicability — it’s especially helpful for teams of remote workers, but it’s been used for everything from coming up with new product ideas to deciding where to go to lunch. We're continuing to add features and refine functionality, and we welcome new contributors.
