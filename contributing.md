Welcome to Brainstorm! If you'd like to contribute, here are some features we're working on implementing:


* Refactor socket to deal with permissions problem

* Search users in invite feature

* Add custom profile photo option

* Notifications for session invites and updates

* Tutorial

* Add new sessions to profile without refresh

* Create color options/themes

* Implement collision detection for nodes

* Sort session titles based on “modified” property

* Make all sessions in “new sessions” user array bold

* When a user clicks a bolded session, it calls the /newSessionStatus route and removes the session from new sessions
